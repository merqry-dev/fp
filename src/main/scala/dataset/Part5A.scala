/**
 * PART 5A - DATASET1 / REAL LIFE APPLICATION
 *
 * In the following questions you will solve realistic problems with the 
 * techniques you learned in this assignment. You will be working with data of 
 * San Francisco Library patrons.
 *
 * Below you can find what each field means.
 * Id: Id of patron
 * Patron Type Definition: Description of patron (adult, teen, child, senior, 
 * etc.).
 * Total Checkouts: Total number of items the patron has checked out from the 
 * library since the record was created.
 * Total Renewals: Total number of times the patron has renewed checked-out 
 * items.
 * Age Range: Age ranges: 0 to 9 years, 10 to 19 years, 20 to 24 years, 
 * 25 to 34 years, 35 to 44 years, 45 to 54 years, 55 to 59 years,
 * 60 to 64 years 65 to 74 years, 75 years and over. Some blank.
 * Home Library Definition: Description of the branch library where the 
 * patron was originally registered.
 * Circulation Active Month: Month the patron last checked out library 
 * materials, or last logged into the library’s subscription databases
 * from a computer outside the library.
 * Circulation Active Year: Year the patron last checked out library materials, 
 * or last logged into the library’s subscription databases from a computer
 * outside the library.
 * Notice Preference Definition: Description of the patron’s preferred method of
 * receiving library notices.
 * Provided Email Address: Indicates whether the patron provided an email 
 * address.
 * Year Patron Registered: Year patron registered with library system. 
 * No dates prior to 2003 due to system migration.
 * Outside of County: If a patron's home address is not in San Francisco, then 
 * flagged as true, otherwise false.
 * Supervisor District: Based on patron address: San Francisco Supervisor 
 * District. Note: This is an automated field, please note that if
 * "Outside of County" is true, then there will be no supervisor district.
 * Also, if the input address was not well-formed, the supervisor district
 * will be blank.
 *
 * Solve the following questions using functional programming. 
 * The code for reading the file is already given.
 *
 * This part is worth 9 points
